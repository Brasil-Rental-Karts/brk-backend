# BRK Backend

TypeScript-based Node.js backend with Express using clean architecture

## Quick Start with Docker 🐳

The fastest way to get started for development is using Docker Compose:

```bash
# Initial setup
./setup-docker.sh setup

# Start all services (PostgreSQL, Redis, Backend)
./setup-docker.sh start

# Run database migrations (after services are started)
docker-compose exec brk-backend npm run migration:run

# View logs
./setup-docker.sh logs

# Stop services
./setup-docker.sh stop
```

For detailed Docker instructions, see [DOCKER.md](DOCKER.md).

## Project Structure

The project follows clean architecture principles:

```
src/
├── controllers/     # Handle HTTP requests and responses
├── services/        # Business logic
├── repositories/    # Data access layer
├── models/          # Domain entities
├── dtos/            # Data Transfer Objects
├── middleware/      # Express middleware
├── config/          # Application configuration
└── utils/           # Utility functions
```

## Database Setup

This project uses TypeORM with PostgreSQL. You can set up the database in two ways:

### Using Docker Compose (Recommended)

1. Make sure Docker and Docker Compose are installed on your system
2. Run the following command to start PostgreSQL:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

This will start:
- PostgreSQL database on port 5432 (or the port specified in your .env file)

To stop the containers:

```bash
docker-compose down
```

To stop the containers and remove the volumes (this will delete all data):

```bash
docker-compose down -v
```

### Manual Setup

1. Make sure PostgreSQL is installed and running on your system
2. Create a database named `brk_competition` (or configure environment variables for your database)
3. Configure database connection details in `.env` file

```
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=5432
DB_USERNAME=postgres
DB_PASSWORD=your_password
DB_DATABASE=brk_competition
DB_SSL=false
```

## Migration Commands

The following commands are available for database migrations:

- `npm run migration:create -- src/migrations/MigrationName` - Create a new migration file
- `npm run migration:generate -- src/migrations/MigrationName` - Generate a migration from entity changes
- `npm run migration:run` - Run pending migrations
- `npm run migration:revert` - Revert the most recent migration
